# Bounded Context Definition Template
#
# PURPOSE: Define domain boundaries where a particular model and ubiquitous language are valid.
#
# USAGE:
#   1. Copy this file to: 02-capabilities/bounded-contexts/BC-{NNN}-{name}.yaml
#   2. Replace all {placeholder} values with actual content
#   3. Remove sections that don't apply (keep file minimal)
#
# ID CONVENTION: BC-{NNN} where NNN is a 3-digit sequence number (e.g., BC-001, BC-002)
#
# WHEN TO CREATE:
#   - Multiple teams work on related functionality with different domain models
#   - Domain terminology varies across the organization
#   - Integration patterns between domains need explicit documentation
#   - Doing strategic DDD (Domain-Driven Design) work
#
# WHEN NOT TO CREATE:
#   - Simple capability additions
#   - Technical/infrastructure ABBs
#   - Single-team deliverables

bounded_context:
  # === IDENTITY ===
  id: BC-{NNN}                           # Unique identifier (e.g., BC-001)
  name: "{Context Name}"                 # Human-readable name (e.g., Customer, Risk, Operations)
  description: |
    Brief description of what this bounded context represents and its domain scope.
    Include the primary business domain and organizational alignment.

  # === OWNERSHIP ===
  owner:
    team: "{Team Name}"                  # Team responsible for this context
    contact: "{email or slack channel}"  # How to reach the team (optional)

  # === UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE ===
  # Key domain terms and their definitions within this context.
  # Terms may have different meanings in other contexts - document that here.
  ubiquitous_language:
    - term: "{Term 1}"
      definition: "Definition of this term within this bounded context"
      # other_contexts: "Note if this term means something different elsewhere"
    - term: "{Term 2}"
      definition: "Definition of this term within this bounded context"

  # === USE CASES ===
  # Canonical use cases that belong to this bounded context.
  # These are use cases where this context's domain model applies.
  use_cases:
    - UC-{NNN}                           # Reference to canonical use case
    - UC-{NNN}                           # Reference to canonical use case

  # === CAPABILITIES ===
  # Primary capabilities this bounded context exercises.
  capabilities_primary:
    - CAP-L{0-2}-{XXX}                   # Primary capability
    - CAP-L{0-2}-{XXX}                   # Primary capability

  # === ARCHITECTURE BUILDING BLOCKS ===
  # ABBs used within this bounded context.
  # Note: ABBs may be shared across multiple bounded contexts.
  abbs_internal:
    - AB-{NNN}                           # ABB used by this context
    - AB-{NNN}                           # ABB used by this context

  # === INTEGRATIONS ===
  # How this bounded context integrates with other bounded contexts.
  # Use DDD context mapping patterns to describe relationships.
  integrations:
    - target_context: BC-{NNN}-{Name}    # Target bounded context
      pattern: "{Pattern}"               # Integration pattern (see below)
      description: "Brief description of the integration"
      # data_flows:                      # Optional: describe data flows
      #   - direction: inbound/outbound
      #     data: "What data is exchanged"

# === CONTEXT MAPPING PATTERNS ===
#
# Use these patterns to describe bounded context integrations:
#
# | Pattern              | Use When                                           |
# |----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
# | Customer-Supplier    | One context serves another (upstream → downstream) |
# | Partnership          | Mutual development commitment, co-evolution        |
# | Shared Kernel        | Explicitly shared model portions                   |
# | Published Language   | Standard data contracts, schemas                   |
# | Open Host Service    | Standardized API for external consumers            |
# | Anti-Corruption Layer| Translation between incompatible models            |
# | Conformist           | Downstream conforms to upstream (not recommended)  |
# | Separate Ways        | No integration, independent evolution              |
#
