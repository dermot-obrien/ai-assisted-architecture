# Platform Architecture Dependencies Template
#
# PURPOSE: Document cross-platform and cross-programme dependencies for coordination
#          and risk management.
#
# USAGE:
#   1. Copy this file to: 02-capabilities/platform-dependencies.yaml
#   2. Replace all {placeholder} values with actual content
#   3. Remove sections that don't apply (keep file minimal)
#
# LOCATION: Place at the capabilities level (not per-initiative) as this describes
#           platform-wide dependencies.
#
# WHEN TO CREATE:
#   - Your platform depends on other platforms or programmes
#   - Other platforms or programmes depend on yours
#   - You need to coordinate integration points across organizational boundaries
#
# UPDATE FREQUENCY:
#   - When new dependencies are identified
#   - When dependency status changes (Active → Deprecated)
#   - At programme planning/PI boundaries

# === PLATFORM IDENTITY ===
platform:
  name: "{Platform Name} Architecture"     # e.g., AI Platform Architecture
  owner: "{Programme Name}"                # Programme responsible for this platform
  description: |
    Brief description of what this platform provides and its primary purpose.

# === DEPENDENCIES ===
dependencies:
  # ------------------------------------------------------------------
  # DEPENDS ON: Platforms/programmes this platform requires
  # ------------------------------------------------------------------
  depends_on:
    - platform: "{Platform Name} Architecture"
      owner: "{Programme Name}"
      what_we_need:
        - "{Capability or service 1}"
        - "{Capability or service 2}"

      #   Any important notes about this dependency

    # Add more depends_on entries as needed

  # ------------------------------------------------------------------
  # DEPENDED BY: Platforms/programmes that require this platform
  # ------------------------------------------------------------------
  depended_by:
    - platform: "{Platform Name} Architecture"
      owner: "{Programme Name}"
      what_they_need:
        - "{Capability or service 1}"
        - "{Capability or service 2}"

  # ------------------------------------------------------------------
  # INTEGRATES WITH: Peer platforms with mutual integration
  # ------------------------------------------------------------------
  integrates_with:
    - platform: "{Platform Name} Architecture"
      owner: "{Programme Name}"
      integration_points:
        - "{Integration point 1}"
        - "{Integration point 2}"
      integration_pattern: "{Pattern}"    # Partnership, Shared Kernel, etc.
      status: "{Status}"                  # Active, Planned, Deprecated
      # bidirectional: true               # Optional: indicate mutual dependency

    # Add more integrates_with entries as needed

# === INTEGRATION PATTERNS ===
#
# Use these patterns to describe platform integrations:
#
# | Pattern              | Direction       | Use When                                      |
# |----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
# | Customer-Supplier    | Upstream →      | One platform provides, another consumes       |
# | Partnership          | Bidirectional   | Mutual development commitment, co-evolution   |
# | Published Language   | Upstream →      | Standard interfaces, contracts, schemas       |
# | Open Host Service    | Upstream →      | Standardized API for multiple consumers       |
# | Anti-Corruption Layer| Downstream ←    | Translation from incompatible external models |
# | Conformist           | Downstream ←    | Downstream conforms to upstream (not ideal)   |
# | Shared Kernel        | Bidirectional   | Shared model portions with joint ownership    |
#
# === STATUS VALUES ===
#
# | Status     | Meaning                                                    |
# |------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
# | Active     | Dependency is in production, actively used                 |
# | Planned    | Dependency is planned but not yet available                |
# | In Progress| Dependency is being developed/integrated                   |
# | Deprecated | Dependency is being phased out, migration needed           |
# | Blocked    | Dependency is blocked, requires attention                  |
