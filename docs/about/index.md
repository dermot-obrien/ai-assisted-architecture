## Project Origins

AI-Assisted Architecture emerged from practical experience applying AI tools to architecture work. Key observations:

1. **AI tools are powerful** but need governance
2. **Architects are stretched** and need productivity help
3. **Existing methodologies** don't address AI assistance
4. **Organizations need guidance** on adopting AI in architecture

This project aims to fill that gap with a practical, governed, open-source approach.
