# Provenance Standard

A three-state model for tracking AI-generated content.

## Overview

The provenance standard provides visibility into:

- **Origin** - How content was created
- **Review State** - What validation has occurred
- **Accountability** - Who reviewed and when

## Provenance States

```
┌──────────┐     Generalist      ┌──────────────┐      SME        ┌─────────┐

### ai-raw

**Definition**: AI-generated content with no human review.

**Characteristics**:
- Generated by AI agent
- May contain errors or hallucinations
- Not verified for accuracy
- For working drafts only

**Usage**: Personal working drafts, initial generation

### ai-curated

**Definition**: Reviewed by a generalist for structural integrity.

**Characteristics**:
- Structure follows templates
- Links and references valid
- Obvious errors corrected
- Language is clear
- Technical accuracy NOT verified

**Usage**: Internal team reference, peer review

### draft

**Definition**: Validated by subject matter expert.

**Characteristics**:
- Technical content verified
- Architectural decisions sound
- Standards compliance confirmed
- Ready for formal review

**Usage**: Stakeholder review, governance submission, publication

## Implementation

### YAML Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: "Document Title"
version: "1.0.0"

provenance:
  origin: ai-generated          # How created
  review_state: ai-raw          # Current state
  
  # For ai-curated and draft:
  curated_by: "Name"
  curated_date: "2026-01-31"
  
  # For draft only:
  validated_by: "SME Name"
  validated_date: "2026-02-01"
  sme_domain: "Security"
---
```

### Origin Values

| Origin | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| `ai-generated` | Primarily created by AI |
| `human-authored` | Primarily created by human |
| `collaborative` | Significant AI and human contribution |
| `vendor-provided` | From external vendor |
| `template-derived` | Generated from templates |

## Transition Criteria

### ai-raw → ai-curated

**Reviewer**: Any team member

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Structure follows template
- [ ] All sections complete
- [ ] Links and references valid
- [ ] Diagrams readable
- [ ] No obvious errors
- [ ] Language clear

### ai-curated → draft

**Reviewer**: Subject Matter Expert

**Checklist**:

- [ ] Risks assessed

## Quality Gates

| Gate | Minimum State |
|------|---------------|
| Working draft | `ai-raw` |
| Team review | `ai-curated` |
| Stakeholder review | `draft` |
| Governance forum | `draft` |
| Wiki publication | `draft` |
| External sharing | `draft` |

## Warning Banner

Documents with `ai-raw` state should include:

```markdown
> ⚠️ **AI-Generated Content - Not Reviewed**
> 
> This document was generated by AI and has not been reviewed.
> Content may contain errors. Do not use for decision-making.
```

## Regulatory Alignment

This standard aligns with:

- **EU AI Act Article 50**: AI content labeling requirements
- **C2PA 2.0**: Content provenance tracking
- **NIST AI 100-4**: Digital content transparency

## Quick Reference

| Scenario | Origin | Review State |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| AI drafted, no review | `ai-generated` | `ai-raw` |
| AI drafted, structure reviewed | `ai-generated` | `ai-curated` |
| AI drafted, SME validated | `ai-generated` | `draft` |
| Human wrote with AI help | `collaborative` | `ai-curated` |
| Vendor docs imported | `vendor-provided` | `ai-curated` |
