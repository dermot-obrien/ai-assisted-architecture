# Glossary

Key terms and definitions for AI-Assisted Architecture.

## A

### ABB (Architecture Building Block)
A logical, platform-agnostic component that realizes one or more capabilities. ABBs define what is needed without specifying how it's implemented.

### ADR (Architecture Decision Record)
A document that captures an important architectural decision, including the context, options considered, and rationale for the chosen option.

### Agent
An AI system configured with specific instructions to perform a defined task, such as work management or diagram conversion.

### AI-Curated
A provenance state indicating that AI-generated content has been reviewed by a generalist for structural integrity but not technically validated.

### AI-Raw
A provenance state indicating AI-generated content that has not been reviewed by a human. May contain errors.

## C

### Capability
A business ability that an organization needs, independent of how it's delivered. Organized hierarchically (L0 → L1 → L2).

### Capability Hierarchy
A structured decomposition of business capabilities from high-level (L0) through detailed (L2).

## D

### Draft
A provenance state indicating that content has been validated by a subject matter expert and is ready for formal review.

## E

### Enterprise Context
The strategic setting for architecture work, including vision, business drivers, constraints, and stakeholders.

## P

### Platform Agnostic
Designed to work across multiple technology platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP, on-premise) without modification.

### Provenance
The documented origin and validation history of content, tracking how it was created and what reviews it has undergone.

## S

### SBB (Solution Building Block)
A vendor-specific implementation of an Architecture Building Block. SBBs specify exactly how an ABB is realized on a particular platform.

### SME (Subject Matter Expert)
A domain expert qualified to validate technical accuracy in their area of expertise.

## T

### Traceability
The ability to follow the chain of relationships between architecture artifacts, from capabilities through to solution components.

## W

### Work Item
A unit of architecture work with defined scope, plan, and tracking. Managed through plan.md, progress.yaml, and scope.md files.
