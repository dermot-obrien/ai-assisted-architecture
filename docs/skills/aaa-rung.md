# aaa-rung

Derives each capability's rung on the definition ladder, R0 Unrecognised to R6 In service, per
flow, from the artefacts that exist, and names the specific artefact that blocks the next rung.
Read-only: it never edits a capability or creates what is missing.

Use it when you want to know what rung a capability is on, how far it has been defined, what
blocks it from moving up, whether a recorded or planned rung is backed by evidence, or the
starting and finishing rungs of a piece of work or a planning period.

The ladder itself is explained in [Concepts](../concepts.md#the-definition-ladder) and defined
in `standards/capabilities/standard-definition-ladder.md`.

## Before you start

It needs Python 3.11 or later. PyYAML is used when installed and is not required. It does not
need the `model` skill: it resolves its own bindings.

| Binding | Holds | If unbound |
|---|---|---|
| `capabilityDir` | Capability documents | Every capability is R0 |
| `abbDir` | ABBs | R2 cannot be evidenced |
| `sbbDir` | SBBs | R4 cannot be evidenced |
| `decisionDir` | Decision records | A resolved consideration cannot be confirmed at R3 |
| `considerationDir` | Considerations | R2 needs `open_questions: none` |
| `patternDir` | Patterns | R3 and above cannot be evidenced |
| `localPattern` | Regex for a local box id in a pattern's Building Blocks table | `[model] local_pattern`, then `[0-9]{1,3}` |

Every binding is optional. Leave one unset when the workspace does not keep that kind; the
report then names it, so a blocker it causes reads as a gap in the workspace, not in the
capability. A binding that is set must exist.

## Run it

In your agent, ask "what rung is CAP-012 on?" or type `/aaa-rung`. From a shell:

```bash
python .agents/skills/aaa-rung/bin/rung.py --doctor          # resolve the bindings and stop
python .agents/skills/aaa-rung/bin/rung.py                   # every capability and flow
python .agents/skills/aaa-rung/bin/rung.py CAP-012 -v        # one capability, every blocker
python .agents/skills/aaa-rung/bin/rung.py --json            # for tools and planning
python .agents/skills/aaa-rung/bin/rung.py --check           # exit 1 if a recorded rung claims too much
```

All options and exit codes are in [Commands](../commands.md#rungpy).

## Reading the output

```text
Capability  Flow         Rung        Recorded  Blocking the next rung
----------  -----------  ----------  --------  ----------------------
CAP-100     (all flows)  R2 Bounded            no pattern realises CAP-100 for flow shipping: add realises: [CAP-100] to a logical pattern
            shipping     R2 Bounded  R2        no pattern realises CAP-100 for flow shipping: add realises: [CAP-100] to a logical pattern
```

- Rung is the highest rung with every rung below it evidenced. With flows, the capability's
  rung is its lowest flow's.
- Recorded is `flows[].rung` from the document: `claimed` when above the derived rung, `stale`
  when below.
- Blocking the next rung is the first check that fails, with `(+N more)` when there are others;
  `-v` shows them all. [Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting.md#rung-blockers) lists every
  blocker and the skill that fixes it.
- `note` lines report latent evidence, which counts once the rungs below hold, and capabilities
  named elsewhere with no document. `unbound` lines name kinds with no folder.

When the agent reports a rung, it quotes the blocker exactly and names the skill that authors
the missing artefact. It never states a rung the tool did not derive.

## In CI

`--check` exits 1 when any flow records a rung the evidence does not support, so a workspace
can keep its recorded rungs honest:

```bash
python .agents/skills/aaa-rung/bin/rung.py --check
```

## In planning

`--json` output feeds planning: a piece of work's starting rung is the derived rung now, and the
rung it reaches is the derived rung at its end. The seam with AI-Assisted Work's planning is
described in `standards/aaw-work-seam.md`.
